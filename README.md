To set up and run the domain information gathering tool, first ensure you have Python 3 installed by checking with `python3 --version`. Install the required libraries using `pip install dnspython requests`. Copy and save the provided script into a file named `domain_info_tool.py`. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x domain_info_tool.py` if you prefer, or you can directly run it with `python3 domain_info_tool.py`. Execute the script by running `./domain_info_tool.py` if you made it executable, or use `python3 domain_info_tool.py` if not. When prompted, enter the domain name you want to investigate. The script will gather and display information about the domain's IP address, DNS records (including A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, and TXT records), and server details.
